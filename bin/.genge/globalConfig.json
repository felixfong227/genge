// I want to use Yarn as default too, but for compatibility reason (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
// But now what you can do is change it to Yarn, so you don't have to add the --yarn flat every sing fu***** times ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
// That really make you feels good right? Using Yarn instead of NPM? ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
// You you you don't have thinking about the life while waiting NPM to install your package? cuz Yarn just finish it right a way ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
// Is this version of Genge only support NPM and Yarn
// If you change it other then that, Genge will throw an error into your face right a way, so you really don't want to do that :/
